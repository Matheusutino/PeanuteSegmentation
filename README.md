# PeanuteSegmentation

This project was developed as the first project for the Computer Vision course in the Master's in Electrical and Computer Engineering (MEEC) program at the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto (FEUP). The goal is to perform segmentation, using traditional techniques, of M&M chocolates of various colors and obtain some statistics such as the number of M&Ms in each photo, area, and standard deviation. In this case, this will be done for two different types of backgrounds: a white one, which would be the initial step, and a noisy one.
